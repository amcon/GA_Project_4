## groupIt 

groupIt is a full stack web application for group content sharing. Much like a facebook private group. You as an admin can create group and invite users to be a part of this group. This content is locked into the group so you can feel safe to be as open as you and the members would like.

### User Story

This is an application for the paranoid millenial who wants to share whatever content they want amongst friends, lovers, etc and not worry that facebook is going to leak it to their family/colleagues. You log in and have access to all of your groups and create a new group. Post in the group and it will render in time.  

### Walkthrough

Once signed in, you get your first group and can start chatting. You can update your user info, post to the group and toggle to different groups. 
 

The application uses a SQL database and is deployed on Heroku.
